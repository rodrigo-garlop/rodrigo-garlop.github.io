I have created this site to share a bit about the things I'm learning everyday.
The site's content will address different topics: my range of hobbies is wide, and I'm a passionate learner.
My objective is you can use the site as a learning source.
My commitment is to provide high quality content.

I'm looking forward to read your feedback.
I'm seeking for concise corrections and that you point me errors I've made rather than just vague suggestions on how to improve the site.
I love nitpickers, and I want every sentence to be perfect.
English is my second language, so once in a while I can make some kinder garden grammar mistakes.
I would love that you point them out.

As of today, 2023-02-26, there is nothing at ro2wiki.
Be patient, content will be slowly flowing.
