I created a new section called _vocabulary_.
You can reach this section through the nav menu.
There you will find a set of vocabulary lists in different languages.
Each list contains 12 words with their meanings and examples.
Through each list you can also access a quiz.
The quiz is a help tool to evaluate if you understand the meanings of the words in the list.

How do I build the lists?
I extract the words from the novels and books I read.
Then, I look for their meanings and examples in prestigious dictionaries.
Finally, I randomly group the words in lists of 12 items.
